    <p>
        I’m <strong>Tyler Crutchley</strong>, a photography and cinematography senior at <strong>Barbara Ingram School for the Arts.</strong>
      My passion for filmmaking began in middle school, although it wasn’t until high school that I truly fell in love with the craft.
      Video production and animation classes helped me discover my passion for storytelling through visual media, and sparked my interest in cinematography.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a long time I've been drawn to creating stories I'd want to watch myself, and never follow a formula. I want audiences to connect to and see themselves in the characters.
      My work often draws inspiration from unconventional studios and directors, such as Corridor Digital, Ex Blue, Glitch Productions, BPS.Space, and Markiplier.
      Over the past few years, I've directed and produced several short films, including horror thrillers and family holiday pieces, with screenings at the 
    <strong>Maryland International Film Festival</strong>, <strong>72 Film Fest</strong> in Frederick, and the <strong>BISFA Holiday Spectacular</strong>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether I'm behind the camera or in the editing suite, I thrive on every step of the process, especially being on set and bringing stories to life. I love working with tools like the Sony FX30, Premiere Pro, and Blender, creating intense color grades and distinct visuals that bring depth to every 
    project. Though I value collaboration, I also enjoy taking the lead on projects, ensuring my vision is realized from start to finish. I've also learned to
    adapt quickly, often taking on three to four roles to meet tight deadlines and high standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking forward, I plan to attend an AV trade school to further hone my skills in cinematography and production. Afterwards, I plan to go straight into 
    the film industry, with the ultimate goal of building my own entertainment company where creators like me can tell the stories that matter most to them.
    With every project, I grow a little more as a filmmaker, and I can't wait to see what's next.
